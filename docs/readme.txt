- Advanced search functionality
- Categories management

This module can be used in various ways, for example:
- Business directory
- Library
- CD collection



Full list of features:
==========================
* Manage multiple directories with one module
With EFQ Directory it is possible to manage multiple directories with completely different characteristics. The different directories each have their own set of categories and listings.

* Customizable categories
 Each category can have its own set of fields. In a library directory for example a listing in the category "Books" will have a field 'ISBN number' while this field should not be available in the category "DVD's".

*Manage field types
Several field types can be defined by the administrator, for example: textbox, text area, multiple select box, radio buttons, DHTML text area.

* Approve reject submitted listings
Administrators can approve or reject newly submitted listings. Also they can edit listings.

* Customizable templates
Administrators can easily adjust the listings templates by the use of sections. Each listing field can be assigned to one of the sections in the template, so that view of a listing can be customized easily by assigning a different section to a category field.

* Coupon management
Listing owners can add coupons to their listings.

* Flexible directory folder name
To change the default directory name of the module, only the directory name in the xoops_version.php file needs to be changed.
